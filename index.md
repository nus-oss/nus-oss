## {{ icon_tick }} Benefits

Doing work outside modules will set you apart from those who are only good in academic work and will increase your chances of getting,

* paid internships in our OSS projects (more info [below](#paid-internships))
* good internship offers from other companies for SIP/ATAP
* entry to selection-based modules such as CS3281&2, CS3216, CS3217
* tutorships in related modules

## {{ icon_tick }} How to get started

Each of the projects have their own documentation on how to get started.

If you have limited experience outside project in school modules, you can start with a smaller project such as those in [SE-EDU](https://github.com/se-edu) and move to bigger projects after a while.

Vacations are especially good times to get started on our projects as our projects are more active during those times. We even have dedicated working space in school for those working on our projects during vacation times.

## {{ icon_tick }} Earning modular credit

There are several ways to earn modular credit for OSS work

* [CS3281&2 (Thematic Systems Project)](https://nus-cs3281.github.io/website/) : In these two modules, student work on existing OSS projects, including NUS-OSS projects.
* [CS2103R (Software Engineering - Research)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jY9gYuNP9GBpYlGaLGEaYjusrQfBolmluX1rSc9x9dM/pub?embedded=true) : This is a 1 MC add-on to CS2103/T that you can do in the year immediately after you completed CS2103.
* [CP3108A/B (Independent Work, 2/4MC CS/CU)](http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/cug/catalogue/idm/#CP3108A), [CP3106 (Independent Work, 4MC, Graded)](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/cug/catalogue/idm/#CP3106) : These modules can be used to earn 2MC/4MC for work done in NUS-OSS projects. ==See [here](pages/iwm.html) for more info.==<br>
  Note: Doing NUS-OSS project under these modules is available only in semester 1 (i.e., not available in semester 2) of each academic year, and only for students who have at least 4 more semesters left in their degree program.
* [CP3200 (SIP)](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/programmes/ug/beyond/sip/sip-is/), [CP3880 (ATAP)](http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/programmes/ug/beyond/atap/student/) : Some of the NUS-OSS projects hire interns through these internship programs.
* [FYP (CP4101)](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/programmes/ug/project/fyp/), [Computing Project (CP4106)](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/programmes/ug/project/cp4106/): Modules aimed at final year students.

## {{ icon_tick }} Paid internships

<sub>Some of the interns from 2017 summer batch</sub>

For NUS students, it is possible to get paid for work done in these projects.

* Part time internships : Pay depends on the amount of work, at normal [NSWS scheme](http://www.nus.edu.sg/osa/about/join-us/nsws)
* Full time internships : **$1000-1500** per month. These internships are eligible for SIP and ATAP credit.
* [Google Summer of Code](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/): Our projects have taken part in GSoC 2014 (4 internships), 2015 (6 internships), 2016 (7 internships) 2017 (9 internships), 2018 (5 internships).

**Before you apply**

Before you apply, ensure that you match both our expectations given below.
* Due to the nature of our projects, ==we prefer to select interns who can remain involved with the project== (on a lightweight basis, possibly paid as part time work) even after the internship is over, and help with running the project e.g., mentoring new contributors, review PRs, etc. These projects are currently run by such alumni and that is the only way we can sustain these projects.
* We prefer to recruit students who are interested in our projects for the right reasons (e.g., as an opportunity to improve SE skills, make an impact to many users, or due to genuine interest in the product or the technologies being used etc.) rather than those looking at it purely as an opportunity to earn some money.


**How to apply:**
* SEP/ATAP internships (NUS students): Apply via the school's internship application system.
* Other full time internships: contact project mentor prof Damith (contact given below)
* Part time work: After you have contributed a few PRs to any of the projects above, contact project mentor prof Damith (contact given below) to explore possibilities for paid internships.
